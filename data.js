The gap is in the six days that preceded that message: the team was blocked, morale was declining. The proactive version is sending the forcing-function message on day two \u2014 not day six.",

      { insight:"You gave a team member real authority to make the call \u2014 a powerful empowerment move. The gap is that in doing so, you removed yourself from the adaptive decision entirely. By passing the ownership fully to a team member, you converted an adaptability challenge into an empowerment opportunity \u2014 the adaptive learning went to them rather than to you.",
